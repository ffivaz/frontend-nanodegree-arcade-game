======================================

RUN
---
To run the game, visit http://fabienfivaz.ch/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/ (github pages take some time to 
update after a commit, be patient if you want the latest version.) The game begins as soon as all 
background images are loaded.

Use up, down, left and right arrows to move the boy. At the end of the time, you can restart the game by clicking
the AGAIN button.

RULES
-----

To score a win, the boy has to cross the road and reach the water without touching a bug. Collecting stars is a
bonus. Touching a bug puts you back to the beginning and resets the counters. 
How many stars can you catch in 30 seconds? How many times can you reach the water in 30 seconds?

Final (best) score equals number of wins plus number of collected stars.

ENJOY!
